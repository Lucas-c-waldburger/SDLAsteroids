SDLGeo is a tool that adds additional shape rendering and manipulation to SDL2 using circle and line drawing algorithms. 
Inscribes polygons within circles to enable rotation and resizing. Currently supports triangles, with plans to allow users to specify 
number of sides and create any aribitrary n-gon.
